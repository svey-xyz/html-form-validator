## Getting started
### Installation
```shell
npm install vldx
```
### Usage
Start by importing the vldx library into your project. `(CDN support coming soon.)`
#### ESM
```js
import vldx from 'vldx';
let validator = new vldx();
```
#### CJS
```js
const vldx = require('vldx');
let validator = new vldx();
```

If you plan on only using predefined rules this is all the Javascript that is required. `(Future versions of vldx won't even require this step, and will rely only on a CDN script tag in your HTML.)`

#### HTML
vldx relies on HTML classes and data to validate your forms.


#### Minimal Example Structure
```HTML
<form class="vldx-form" method="POST" action="https://your-api-route/">
	<!-- Optional honeypot field -->
    <input hidden aria-hidden="true" name="bot-field" class="vldx-honeypot"/>

	<!-- Rules are defined with 'data-vldx-rules' on any field with the class 'vldx-field' -->
	<input type="text" name="name" class="vldx-field" data-vldx-rules="required" />
	<input type="email" name="email" class="vldx-field" data-vldx-rules="email|required" />

	<!-- Submission button -->
	<button class="vldx-submit" data-callback='onSubmit' data-action='submit'></button>

	<!-- Optional response field | Stylized with .vldx-failure and .vldx-success classes -->
	<span class="vldx-response hidden"></span>
</form>
```
